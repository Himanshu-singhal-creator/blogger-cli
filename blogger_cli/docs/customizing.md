## Customizing css and js
You can customize the default css by simply going to css folder in your blog folder and changing it. Yeah that's it. For adding css, fonts, js see below in Adding snippets

## Customizing templates
templates are code snippets that are inserted to the html while converting your files.. eg disqus.html and google_analytics.html are template files that store respective snippets.
For Customizing templates you need a dedicated folder. You can name it whatever and store it wherever you want. Although it is recommended to make a folder inside your blog folder.
If you have exported blog_templates previously you may have noticed a \_blogger\_templates folder with some inbuilt templates which is for this purpose.
